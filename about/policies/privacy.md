# Privacy Terms

Please read these Privacy Terms ("Terms") carefully before using any AlphaBrate Apps (the "Service") operated by AlphaBrate ("us", "we", or "our").

We respect your privacy and are committed to protecting your personal information. Here are our detailed privacy terms:

## 1. Information Collection

### i. Personal Information

We may gather personal information that you voluntarily provide while using our services. This can include, but is not limited to, your name, email address, and other contact information. We commit to only collecting personal information that is essential for delivering our services and will not disclose it to third parties, except when mandated by law or when necessary for the provision of our services.

Your data is stored with utmost security and is never shared with third parties for marketing purposes, as detailed in the subsequent “Data Protection” section. This is our pledge to maintaining your privacy and data security.

### ii. Non-Personal Information

We may automatically gather non-personal information when you utilize our services. This encompasses, but is not limited to, your IP address, browser type, device type, operating system, and other related technical data. Additionally, we may collect data about your service usage, such as the pages you access, the duration spent on each page, and the links you engage with.

This information is retained for potential legal considerations and will never be utilized as User Behavior Analytics (UBA) data. Rest assured, we do not collect any personally identifiable information through this process. This is our commitment to maintaining your privacy and data security.

### iii. Your Consent

We respect your privacy. Before collecting any personal information, we will explicitly seek your consent. However, non-personal information may be automatically collected when you utilize our services.

You have the option to withhold personal information, and this decision will not impact the functionality of our services. However, to access certain features such as “Login” or “Register”, providing specific information may be necessary.

By using our services, you are consenting to the collection and use of your information in accordance with these Terms. This is our commitment to maintaining transparency and trust with our users.


### iv. Data Protection

We prioritize your data security. All data transmitted to our servers is safeguarded using SSL/TLS encryption along with our proprietary encryption algorithms. This data is stored in secure databases, protected by robust algorithms to prevent unauthorized access. 

To ensure the continuous safety of your information, we conduct regular security audits. Importantly, your sensitive data is never stored as plain text. It is always encrypted, even within our databases, ensuring that no one, not even our employees, can access the original data in its unencrypted form under any circumstances. This is our commitment to maintaining the highest level of data security.

## 2. Use of Information

The collected information is used to improve our services and provide a better user experience. This includes, but is not limited to, improving website functionality, enhancing user interface, and providing personalized content recommendations. We may also use the information for research and analysis to better understand how users interact with our services.

## 3. Information Sharing

We do not share your information with third parties, except as required by law, User Behavior Analytics (UBA) or as necessary to provide our services. This includes service providers who assist us in our operations, such as website hosting, data analysis, and verifier provider. These service providers are contractually obligated to protect your information and use it only for the purposes for which it was disclosed.

## 4. Data Security

We implement security measures to protect your information from unauthorized access, alteration, disclosure, or destruction. These measures include data encryption, secure databases, and firewalls. We also conduct regular security audits to ensure the ongoing safety of your information. While we take reasonable precautions to protect your information, no security system is impenetrable. We cannot guarantee the security of your information and are not responsible for unauthorized access to it.

## 5. Data For Your AlphaBrate Account

When you create an AlphaBrate account, we collect and store information that is necessary for the operation of your account. This includes, but is not limited to, your username, email address, and password. Your password is stored securely using encryption and cannot be accessed by anyone, including our staff.

We may also collect additional optional information to enhance your user experience. This could include preferences, interests, and other details that help us tailor our services to you.

Please note that you have the right to access, modify, and delete your personal data at any time. To do so, simply navigate to your account settings or contact our support team.

Remember, the security of your AlphaBrate account data is our top priority. We implement stringent measures to protect it from unauthorized access or disclosure. However, it’s also important for you to safeguard your account details and ensure that your password is strong and unique.

## 6. Changes to This Privacy Policy

We may update our Privacy Policy from time to time. We will notify you of any large changes by posting the new Privacy Policy to your AlphaBrate Account. We encourage you to review this Privacy Policy periodically for any changes.

## 7. Translations of This Privacy Policy

This Privacy Policy is written in English. If there are any discrepancies between the English version and a translated version, the English version will prevail.
