## 9. Service Reliability

Our service strives to provide reliability, but it’s important to note that we cannot guarantee that the service will be available at all times. Downtime may occur due to maintenance, updates, or other unforeseen circumstances. We make every effort to notify users of any planned downtime and to minimize the impact on your usage of the service. However, we are not responsible for any loss or damage that may result from the unavailability of the service.

Our server-related services, such as adding ratings, logging in or signing up, may occasionally be unreliable. This is due to our dependence on free service providers such as render.com, which inherently have certain constraints. If you access our server’s URL and discover that the service has been suspended, it’s likely a result of high demand. Please be assured that the service will be reinstated in line with Render’s policy within a month.

The server will be automatically suspended if there is no activity for a very short period. This is the policy of the free service provider. You can visit the server’s URL to reactivate the service with a little delay. The server may also be temporarily suspended for maintenance. This is a normal procedure to ensure the server’s optimal performance. The service will be reinstated after the maintenance is completed.

The server has limitations on the number of users and the amount of data that can be stored. If the server reaches its limit, the service will be suspended and restarted. You can visit the server’s URL to reactivate the service.

The server will be down if there is too much uptime. This is the policy of the free service provider. During this suspension period, viewing of rating data is still possible, but updates and uploads on any data cannot be made. The cached rating data, which users can view, is appended to a file and updated periodically, not in real time. This means that the most recent ratings may not be immediately visible. We kindly ask for your patience during these times as the cached rating data will be refreshed after a certain interval. We greatly appreciate your understanding and patience. Thank you for bearing with us.

## 10. Translations of This Privacy Policy

This Terms of Service is written in English. If there are any discrepancies between the English version and a translated version, the English version will prevail.

## 11. Changes to Terms of Service

We may update our Terms of Service from time to time. The new Terms of Service will take effect immediately upon posting on this page. We encourage you to review this page periodically for any changes. Your continued use of the Service after the new Terms of Service are posted will constitute your agreement to the new Terms of Service. If you do not agree to the new Terms of Service, please stop using the Service.

## 12. Contact Us

If you have any questions about these Terms of Service, please contact us. We are committed to resolving any concerns or complaints you may have about our use of your information.
