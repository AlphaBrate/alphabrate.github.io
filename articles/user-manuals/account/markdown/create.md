## Username Requirements

1. Use only English letters and numbers.
2. No repeated username.
3. Not misleading username.

> Misleading usernames are usernames that intentionally mimic well-known companies, organizations, or famous individuals. For instance, using a username like `GO0GLE` would fall into this category. Those names could be reported and be removed from your account.

<hr>

No password requirement. But it is recommended:

1. **Unique Passwords**
   > Always use a different password for each website or service. 
   > <br>Reusing passwords across multiple sites can be risky.
2. **Avoid Predictable Patterns**
   > Refrain from using easily guessable information like
   ><br>your username, birthday, or common phrases.
3. **Avoid Common Passwords**
   > Steer clear of overly common passwords
   > <br>such as `123456` or `password`.
4. **Length Matters**
    > Longer passwords (more than 8 characters)
    > <br>are generally more secure.
