## Overview

AlphaBrate Musician Tools is now under development (ÃŸ 0.1.1). Only the Metronome feature is currently available.

## Metronome

Our Metronome feature provides a realistic but user-friendly and intuitive interface for practicing musicians. Just like a traditional metronome, it allows you to set the tempo, time signature, but will also include advanced features like subdivision, polyrhythms, and customizable sounds at the future stages of development.
