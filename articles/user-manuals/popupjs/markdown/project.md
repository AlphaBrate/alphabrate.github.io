## Overview

PopupJS is a lightweight JavaScript library that provides a simple way to create alerts, popups, and pull-outs for your web application. It's easy to use and customize, and works well with modern web browsers.

## Name

`PopupJS` is the project name. A pop-up is a small window that appears over a web page, commonly used for alerts, messages, or forms. The `JS` suffix signifies that the project is written in JavaScript. Although standard naming rules often separate words with capital letters, in this project, `Pop` and `up` are combined as `Popup` while it is supposed to be `PopUp` or `Pop-up`. This naming convention was chosen by the AlphaBrate team.

## Versions

### CDN

In situations where the latest version of a library is not available on GitHub, you may utilize the `pu.min.js` and `pu.min.css` files hosted on the `alb-cdn.web.app` server. These files are consistently updated and can be used in your projects. `Alb-cdn.web.app` serves as the official CDN for all AlphaBrate projects. The `pu.min.js` and `pu.min.css` files are minified versions of the PopupJS library, optimized for production use. Although the source code is accessible on GitHub, updates may not be as timely as those provided through the CDN.

To get an specific version, you can use the following URL format:

```no-highlight
https://alb-cdn.web.app/popupjs/x.x.x/pu.min.ext
(Version x.x.x)

https://alb-cdn.web.app/popupjs/pu.min.ext
(Latest version)
```

Replace `x.x.x` with the version number you want to use, and `ext` with either `js` or `css` depending on the file you need.

### Versioning

PopupJS adheres to the Semantic Versioning 2.0.0 guidelines. The major version is increased for incompatible changes. In version 1, there are three main notification functions: alerts, popups, and pull-outs. Minor versions may include updates to the user interface and experience. Patch versions will address bug fixes and minor improvements.
