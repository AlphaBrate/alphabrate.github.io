AlphaBrate Music Terms doesn't just provide a easy dictionary for musical terms. It also provides a lot of features that can help you to remember and understand the terms. If you have tried the basic features and want to know more, you can continue reading this article to learn about the advanced features of the app.

## Image Search

The app’s Image Search feature allows you to search for terms using images. If it is not convenient for you to type the term, you can use the Image Search feature to find the term you want. To use this feature, first, enable the <span class="nowrap">![Experimental Functions](assets/mst_exp.svg?size=text&bg=transparent&float-vert=center&invert=true) **Experimental Functions**</span> in the app’s settings. Then, go to the <span class="nowrap">![Search](assets/mst_search.svg?size=text&bg=transparent&float-vert=center&invert=true) **Search Page**</span> and tap the <span class="nowrap">![Text Recognition](assets/mst_blur.svg?size=text&bg=transparent&float-vert=center&invert=true) **"Text Recognition"**</span> button. You can then take a photo of the term you want to search for, or upload an image from your device. Resize the image to fit the search box, then tap on the words you want to search for. Then, tap the <span class="nowrap">![Search](assets/mst_search.svg?size=text&bg=transparent&float-vert=center&invert=true) **Search**</span> button to start the search.
